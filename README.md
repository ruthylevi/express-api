# express-api

## Results
Following the lab, I was able to create a full-fledged API that runs on a Node.js Express server and connects to a MySQL database.

## Progress
I was able to complete this lab in full and add myself into the database as a user. "http://localhost:3002/handles" confirms this with the response "Developer added".

## Problems Experienced
I had difficulty in the beginning getting the server to run, but after a quick google search, trying "http://localhost:3002" instead of "https://localhost:3002" made the difference in loading the server.
